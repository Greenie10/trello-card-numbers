# Trello Card Numbers
This chrome extension adds card numbers to trello cards to help when viewing boards with a group of people. Trello actually includes card numbers but hides them by default.
## Overview
This extension does the following:
- Reveals card numbers on cards themselves
- Reveals the card count for a given list
- Adds are card number to a created card
- Adds a card number head in the detail view

## Credit
This project was based off the widely available bookmarklet for trello numbers found [here](http://goo.gl/yKfjV).
